# üé¨ Movie EDA Visualizer

A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that dives into trends, insights, and patterns in the film industry. Using Python, the project analyzes features like genres, IMDb ratings, runtime, votes, and gross revenue to better understand what drives a movie‚Äôs popularity and success.

## üìå Project Description

This project performs data cleaning, transformation, and insightful visualizations on a movie dataset. It explores trends across genres, ratings, votes, revenue, and other features, revealing hidden patterns in the film domain. All analysis is performed using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## üìÅ Dataset Columns

The dataset contains the following key columns:

| Column     | Description                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| MOVIES     | Title of the movie                         |
| YEAR       | Year of release                            |
| GENRE      | Genres associated with the movie           |
| RATING     | IMDb rating (0‚Äì10)                         |
| ONE-LINE   | A summary of the movie                     |
| STARS      | Lead actors/actresses                      |
| VOTES      | Number of IMDb votes                       |
| RunTime    | Movie duration in minutes                  |
| Gross      | Gross revenue of the film in USD           |

## üßº Data Cleaning Process

- Removed duplicates and irrelevant rows.
- Extracted 4-digit years using regex.
- Handled multiple genres in a single cell.
- Converted `VOTES` and `Gross` columns from strings to numeric values.
- Stripped whitespace and handled null values.
- Saved cleaned data to `cleaned_data.csv`.

## üìä Exploratory Visualizations

1. IMDb Ratings Distribution ‚Äì Viewer sentiment breakdown.
2. Most Frequent Genres ‚Äì Popular genre count.
3. Average Rating by Genre ‚Äì Which genres get the best reviews?
4. Gross Revenue Histogram ‚Äì Film revenue distribution.
5. Average Gross per Genre ‚Äì Revenue comparison across genres.
6. Votes vs Gross Scatterplot ‚Äì Popularity vs revenue.
7. Gross Over Time ‚Äì Revenue trends over the years.
8. Correlation Heatmap ‚Äì Numeric feature relationships.

Each visualization includes analysis and real-world interpretation.
